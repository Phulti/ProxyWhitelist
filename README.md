# ProxyWhitelist

This project is including a **Whitelist-System** for Minecraft Server Networks. 


# Content

This Whitelist-System can create both whitelists for specific servers and for the proxy itself.

## Proxy-Whitelist

The proxy whitelist can be used to prevent the connection of users to the whole network.

## Server-Specific-Whitelist

Besides the proxy whitelist itself it is also possible to create a whitelist for every server connected to the proxy.
Within these whitelists you can add, delete and temporal add users that should or shouldn't be able to connect to a 
specific server within the network.
